End of the year. Yup, here we are again. Just like last year with no significant achievements for most of us. But that's not a bad thing, in my opinion. The thing that we should have in mind is that we should be better that who we were yesterday or last year. It doesn't matter if we are better than anyone else on earth. They're not you.

I took a full week of vacation leave, just to take care my family. Never had a plan to go somewhere for vacation. Not on holiday season. The traffic would be a little version of hell on earth.

I don't celebrate new year. But I welcoming new month, as always. For me, every new month means new great agenda. And I don't want to miss a chance to make it better.
