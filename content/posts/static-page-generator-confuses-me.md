I want to use github pages to host my static blog. I'm lazy to do it on hosting company. Not gonna do that in the near future.

I tried Jekyll, I don't feel confortable doing it. Changed my mind, and chose Hugo. Then confused by Hugo. I followed technical tutorial on web. Do the steps carefully, but ended up in the middle of blank website that only shows my README file content :sweat:

10 years of web development experience seems not really helpful in this situation. This kind of tech is easier to follow for younger coder. Ok, I'll stop complaining.

I'll figure it out.
