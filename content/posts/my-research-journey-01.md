title: "My Research Journey | From Finding Gaps to Finding My 'Click'"
draft: false
---
Starting my thesis journey felt a lot like stepping into a massive, unfamiliar jungle — exciting but also terrifying.

I knew from the beginning that I wanted to do something with  **computer vision** .

But *computer vision* is such a vast ocean: detection, segmentation, classification, enhancement — where do you even begin?

At first, I did what most people do: I read. I read papers like they were treasure maps, each promising a path toward some "undiscovered land" of innovation.

But the deeper I went, the more I realized:  **everything felt taken** .

Every idea I thought about seemed to already have five papers, a GitHub repo, and a full-fledged competition around it.

There were moments when I genuinely wondered:

*"Am I even capable of finding a gap?"*

At one point, I even started doubting the process. Maybe "finding a gap" wasn’t about discovering an untouched continent — maybe it was about noticing a **small crack** in an existing structure.

And that’s when something clicked.

While exploring the area of  **semantic segmentation** , especially for UAV (drone) imagery used in post-disaster scenarios, I noticed a consistent pattern:

Researchers focused heavily on improving accuracy, squeezing out that extra 1–2% on benchmark datasets.

But few people talked seriously about  **computational efficiency** , especially for deployment on edge devices where power, memory, and speed matter.

It wasn't a grand gap. It wasn’t a revolutionary field.

But it was  *real* .

And sometimes, that’s more than enough.
