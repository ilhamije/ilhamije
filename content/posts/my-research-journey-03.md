If there's one myth I wish someone shattered earlier, it’s this:

**You don't have to do everything alone.**

Throughout the early stages, I mostly kept to myself.

I thought "real researchers" figured things out solo, spending long nights battling code until breakthroughs happened.

It was lonely. It was draining.

Then, I started talking — really talking — to my research teammates.

Not formal meetings. Not forced check-ins.

Just genuine conversations about the confusion, the doubts, the "I have no idea what’s happening" moments.

One of those conversations changed everything.

I was rambling about trying to implement a complex transformer variant for segmentation, hoping it would magically solve my efficiency issues.

One teammate listened patiently, then said something simple:

*"Why are you trying to make it complicated? Sometimes polishing a simple method is harder and more impactful."*

That hit me.

I realized I was  **chasing complexity** , thinking complexity would equal innovation.

But **refining simplicity** — now *that* was true skill.

After that, I revisited simple ideas like  **shift operations** .

Instead of adding more, I started asking:

* *Can I make it lighter?*
* *Can I make it faster without killing performance?*
* *Can I make it more robust for messy, real-world inputs?*

We brainstormed together. We challenged each other’s assumptions.

And over time, I stopped feeling like I was wandering aimlessly.

I had a direction.

I had a purpose.

The "click" wasn’t a single moment. It was  **a series of small realizations** , built through discussion, reflection, and humility.
