## How I Manage Anxiety While Waiting for My Thesis Defense Schedule

Waiting can be harder than doing. Especially when it comes to *waiting* for something as big as your  **thesis defense** . If you're anything like me, once you submit your final draft and all your paperwork is complete, the silence that follows is almost unbearable.

You keep refreshing your inbox. You keep wondering,  *“What if they forgot?”* ,  *“What if I messed up?”* , or the classic, *“Am I even ready for this?”*

Here’s how I managed (and still manage) my anxiety during that limbo phase — and maybe this will help you too:

---

### 1. **I Accepted the Uncertainty**

First, I had to come to terms with a hard truth: *This part is out of my control.* The committee has their own timeline. Stressing about when the schedule will be released won’t speed it up. Repeating this to myself (literally, like a mantra) helped me avoid spiraling.

---

### 2. **I Set Boundaries with My Thoughts**

I limited how often I allowed myself to “check” on the situation. For example, I told myself I could check my email just 2–3 times a day instead of every hour. I even turned off notifications. This small change gave my mind some breathing room.

---

### 3. **I Kept My Hands Busy**

I worked on small, unrelated tasks — things like reorganizing my files, working out at home, reading fiction, or even cleaning. It wasn’t about productivity. It was about keeping my hands moving so my brain wouldn’t spiral.

---

### 4. **I Practiced “Soft” Preparation**

Instead of obsessively rehearsing my slides or rereading my thesis over and over, I reviewed just *one* part a day. One figure. One paragraph. I treated it like maintenance, not pressure. That way, I felt *ready* without feeling *burned out.*

---

### 5. **I Let My Friends In**

I told my close friends and family exactly what I was feeling: the restlessness, the overthinking, the dread of “not knowing.” Saying it out loud made it feel smaller. And they reminded me of what I had already accomplished.

---

### 6. **I Reminded Myself of the Bigger Picture**

This defense, though important, is *not* the end-all-be-all of who I am. It’s a milestone — not a measure of my worth. I wrote that down and stuck it above my desk:

📝 *You’re not just defending your thesis — you’re celebrating your work.*

### In the End…

Waiting is hard. But it doesn’t have to break you. If you’re in the same boat, just know: it’s okay to feel anxious. You’ve come this far — and when the time comes, you’ll be ready.

Until then, be gentle with yourself. You’re doing great.
